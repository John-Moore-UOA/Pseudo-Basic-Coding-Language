# Pseudo-Basic-Coding-Language

A Casio BASIC inspired coding language

This is written in java, using regex to identify commands and values from a txt file.

The idea was to implement this into a university game assignment.  
But due to the nature of the assignment, I have deemed it to complex for a university project.  


I will rather work on this in my spare time.

# Example

```
LET integerValue = 1
LET str = abc

LET temp = 0

IF integerValue == 1
temp = 10
ELSE
temp = 20
ENDIF

LET i = 0
WHILE temp > i DO
PRINT temp
LOOP
```

# Done
- variable Map
- LET statement
- Integer Type
- String Type
- recognise IF, WHILE, THEN, DO, ENDIF, LOOP

# Todo
- PRINT method
- String concatenation
- integer operations
- while loop
- if then else statements
- file type, from txt to .something
- on the go compiling, with a vs code extension, or just a macro..
